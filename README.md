# Objective of the Project 🎏
The main objective of the Employee
Subcontracting System is to enhance and
upgrade the existing system with more efficiency
and added features. Our project is built to
manage employee records to hire on a temporary
basis for prospective employers. The project will
not only reduce the manual work for the
managing companies but also increase the
employment rates in the country. It tracks all the
details of the employee and is made keeping the
current situation of the world where remote work
is one of the most popular methods of
employment. The project, above all, provides
transparency to the employees.

# Module Documentation 📜
1. random Module: It generates variables.
2. mysql.connector: MySQL Connector/Python enables
Python programs to access MySQL databases, using an API
that is compliant with the Python Database API
Specification v2.0 (PEP 249). It is written in pure Python
and does not have any dependencies except for the
Python Standard Library.
3. getpass: They are useful whenever a terminal based
application needs to be executed only after validating user
credentials. It prompts the user to enter a password.
4. os: It assigns its path attribute to an os-specific path
module.
# Limitations 😥
- This is a prototype model for a real life system.
- This prototype doesn’t allow simultaneous subcontracting.
- The number of records here is limited.
- A graphical user interface (GUI) could make the interaction
better.
